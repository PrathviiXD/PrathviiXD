# Hey, I'm Prathvi 👋

I'm currently a CSE student at SISTec Bhopal (Batch of 2029).  
I don't know everything — but I'm learning something new every day.

---

## 🔭 Right Now
- Trying to understand coding, AI, and real-world problems.
- Working on **AYU.AI**, a health assistant app idea.
- Exploring how tech can solve small but meaningful problems.

---

## 🎯 My Focus
- Learning Python and Web Development from scratch.
- Asking questions, making mistakes, and figuring things out.
- Not trying to be perfect — just trying to be better than yesterday.
